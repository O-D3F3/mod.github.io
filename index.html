        <p>
            Hi :) I'm Diogo Figueiredo and I fell in love with video games at 2 years of age and ever since I've always wondered how they are done.
            I've recently graduated from IPCA as an Engineer in Development of Digital Games, and currently working on my master's degree on the same course.
            When developing games, I mainly orbit around gameplay and shader programming, providing compelling mechanics and visuals to my games.
        </p>

                In here I showcase every project I've worked as a gameplay programmer mainly focusing on player interaction and puzzle mechanics
                and as a technical artist, making shaders, textures and some 3D Assets
            </p>
